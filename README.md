## Abstract
- Find patterns and create data visualizations between UFO sightings across the US.
- Create model to predict locations of future sightings.
- Incorporate weather data for stronger models and visualizations.

## Datasets used
[UFO Sightings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahityasetu/ufo-sightings)


# UFO Sightings Analysis Web Application

A web application that analyzes UFO sighting patterns and provides predictions using machine learning.

## Features
- Interactive map visualization of UFO sightings
- Monthly sighting distribution analysis
- Text analysis of sighting descriptions
- Machine learning-based sighting prediction

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your Replit workspace
2. Ensure all required packages are installed from pixi.toml
3. Run the model training first:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Start the web application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Data Analysis
The application includes:
- Geospatial visualization using Plotly
- Time-based analysis of sighting patterns
- Natural language processing of sighting descriptions
- Machine learning predictions for future sightings
